*Python module that performs all necessary computations for thermally induced deformation calculations in triaxial conditions

Most of the information and code is written for readability and tracktability
to the original content rather than for performance. Although optimization
could be possible, it is decided against due to the low computational burden
of the involved calculations. Some example analysis files are loosely integrated
and may possess some level of code repetition which  provides transparency and
readability.

For new analysis based on comprehensive raw data, no such
separation occurs and the entire proper analysis can be conducted following the
template file
